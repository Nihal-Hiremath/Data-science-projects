Customer churn prediction is essential for businesses aiming to retain their customers and reduce revenue loss. This project uses machine learning techniques to identify customers who are likely to stop using a service or product. By analyzing historical customer data—such as usage patterns, demographics, subscription details, and customer support interactions—the model can predict churn behavior with high accuracy.

The workflow includes data cleaning, feature selection, and training predictive models such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests. These models help uncover hidden patterns and key drivers of churn, enabling businesses to take proactive measures like personalized offers, improved service quality, or targeted communication.

Accurate churn prediction not only improves customer retention but also enhances marketing efficiency and long-term customer value. This project highlights how data-driven insights can support strategic decision-making and strengthen customer relationships in a competitive market.
