Accurate crop yield prediction plays a crucial role in agricultural planning, food security, and efficient resource management. This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict crop yields based on factors such as soil conditions, rainfall, temperature, and historical yield data. By analyzing patterns in agricultural datasets, the model can estimate future crop production for specific crops and regions.

The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training using algorithms like linear regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods. These models help identify key factors influencing yield and provide actionable insights for farmers and policymakers.

With growing challenges like climate change and increasing food demand, machine learning offers a scalable and data-driven approach to support smart farming. This project demonstrates how predictive modeling can assist in making informed agricultural decisions, ultimately improving productivity and sustainability in the farming sector.
