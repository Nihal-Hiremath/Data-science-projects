This project focuses on building and evaluating a machine learning model to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. Early and accurate diagnosis of breast cancer can significantly improve treatment outcomes, and this model aims to assist in that goal using data-driven insights.

The detailed explaination about the project and the dataset in the "Description.md" file and the code file is in the ".ipynb" file.
