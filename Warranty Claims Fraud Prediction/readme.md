Warranty claims fraud prediction using machine learning focuses on identifying fraudulent warranty claims by analyzing patterns and anomalies in claim data. By training models on historical claims, including features like claim amount, product details, customer behavior, and repair history, machine learning algorithms can detect suspicious claims that deviate from normal patterns. Techniques such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks are commonly employed. These models help companies reduce financial losses by flagging potentially fraudulent claims for further investigation. Early and accurate fraud detection improves operational efficiency and protects both manufacturers and honest customers. As more data is collected, the system becomes better at distinguishing genuine claims from fraudulent ones, making warranty fraud prediction a powerful tool in risk management.
