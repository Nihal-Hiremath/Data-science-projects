# COVID-19 Analysis

## üìå Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic using publicly available data. It involves performing descriptive, exploratory, and inferential analysis to extract key insights regarding infection rates, mortality, recovery trends, and testing patterns across different countries and continents.

By leveraging data visualization and statistical techniques, the project seeks to answer critical questions such as:

- Which countries and continents were most affected?
- How did testing correlate with case and death rates?
- What are the trends in recovery and mortality?
- How did population size influence COVID-19 spread?

## üîç Objectives

1. **Understand global and regional COVID-19 trends**
2. **Analyze the relationship between testing and infection/death rates**
3. **Identify high-risk and low-risk countries based on severity indicators**
4. **Evaluate healthcare burden using serious/critical case numbers**
5. **Visualize the data through charts, heatmaps, and comparative plots**

## üß™ Methods and Tools Used

- **Python Libraries**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, standardizing column names, type conversion
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Summary statistics, correlation analysis
- **Data Visualization**: Bar plots, line charts, scatter plots, choropleth maps
- **Statistical Analysis**: Per capita metrics, distribution analysis, regional comparisons

## üìà Sample Analyses

- Top 10 countries with highest total cases and deaths
- Correlation heatmap between population, cases, deaths, and tests
- Comparative analysis of testing rates vs. infection rates
- Active vs. recovered cases over time per continent
- Mapping deaths per million using geo-visualization
