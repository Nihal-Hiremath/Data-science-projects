Traffic flow prediction using machine learning involves forecasting future traffic conditions based on historical and real-time data such as vehicle counts, speeds, weather, and road conditions. By analyzing patterns from this data, machine learning models can predict traffic congestion, travel times, and peak hours. Techniques like time series analysis, regression models, and deep learning methods (e.g., LSTM networks) are commonly used for this task. Accurate traffic flow prediction helps city planners optimize traffic signals, reduce congestion, and improve road safety. It also benefits commuters by enabling better route planning and reducing travel delays. With continuous data updates, these models improve over time, making traffic management smarter and more efficient in increasingly complex urban environments.
