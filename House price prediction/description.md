# House Price Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a predictive model to estimate the sale prices of houses using machine learning. The aim is to apply exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and regression techniques to understand which features most impact house prices and to develop a model that can accurately predict prices for unseen data.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

The goal is to predict housing prices based on various attributes such as square footage, location, number of rooms, and more. This type of predictive modeling is highly useful in real estate for price estimation, market analysis, and investment decision-making.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains housing data with multiple explanatory variables describing various aspects of residential homes in a specific area (e.g., Ames, Iowa).

### 🔑 Key Features
- `OverallQual`: Overall material and finish quality
- `GrLivArea`: Above grade (ground) living area in square feet
- `GarageCars`: Size of garage in car capacity
- `TotalBsmtSF`: Total square feet of basement area
- `FullBath`, `TotRmsAbvGrd`, `YearBuilt`, etc.
- `SalePrice`: Target variable (house price)

## 🔍 Objectives

1. Understand relationships between features and house prices.
2. Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.
3. Apply regression models to predict house prices.
4. Evaluate model performance using metrics like RMSE and R².
5. Optimize the model using techniques like feature selection and regularization.
