# House Price Prediction

## üìå Project Overview

This project focuses on building a predictive model to estimate the sale prices of houses using machine learning. The aim is to apply exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and regression techniques to understand which features most impact house prices and to develop a model that can accurately predict prices for unseen data.

## üß† Problem Statement

The goal is to predict housing prices based on various attributes such as square footage, location, number of rooms, and more. This type of predictive modeling is highly useful in real estate for price estimation, market analysis, and investment decision-making.

## üìä Dataset Overview

The dataset contains housing data with multiple explanatory variables describing various aspects of residential homes in a specific area (e.g., Ames, Iowa).

| Column Name           | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| **Id**                | To count the records. |
| **MSSubClass**        | Identifies the type of dwelling involved in the sale. |
| **MSZoning**          | Identifies the general zoning classification of the sale. |
| **LotArea**           | Lot size in square feet. |
| **LotConfig**         | Configuration of the lot. |
| **BldgType**          | Type of dwelling |
| **OverallCond**       | Rates the overall condition of the house. |
| **YearBuilt**         | Original construction year |
| **YearRemodAdd**      | Remodel date (same as construction date if no remodeling or additions). |
| **Exterior1st**       | Exterior covering on house. |
| **BsmtFinSF2**        | Type 2 finished square feet. |
| **TotalBsmtSF**       | Total square feet of basement area. |
| **SalePrice**         | To be predicted. |

## üîç Objectives

1. Understand co - relationships between all the features in the data set and checking the columns which have have co - relationship.
2. Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.
3. Apply regression models to predict house prices.
4. Evaluate model performance the model's accuracy.
5. Optimize the model using techniques like feature selection and regularization.
