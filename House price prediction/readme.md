House price prediction is a widely studied problem in real estate analytics, aiming to estimate property values based on various features. This project uses machine learning to predict housing prices using attributes such as location, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, square footage, year built, and more.

The workflow involves data cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and model training using regression algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. These models capture complex relationships between property features and sale prices, helping generate accurate predictions.

Accurate price estimation benefits buyers, sellers, and real estate agents by providing insights into market trends, fair pricing, and investment opportunities. It also aids in decision-making for banks and insurance companies in loan and policy assessments.

This project highlights how machine learning can enhance real estate forecasting and support smarter, data-driven property decisions. The detailed explaination about the project and the dataset in the "Description.md" file and the code file is in the ".ipynb" file.
