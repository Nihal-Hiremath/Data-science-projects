Loan approval prediction is a valuable application of machine learning in the banking and financial sector. This project aims to automate and improve the accuracy of loan approval decisions by analyzing applicant data such as income, employment status, credit history, loan amount, and property details.

The process includes data preprocessing, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and training classification models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and XGBoost. These models help identify patterns in historical data to predict whether a loan application is likely to be approved or rejected.

By leveraging machine learning, financial institutions can streamline the loan approval process, reduce manual errors, and make fair, consistent decisions. It also helps assess risk more effectively and offer better financial products to customers.

This project demonstrates how AI-driven solutions can enhance decision-making, increase efficiency, and support responsible lending practices.
