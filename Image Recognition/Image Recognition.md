# Image Recognition Using Deep Learning

## üìå Project Overview

This project aims to build an image classification model using deep learning techniques. Image recognition involves the process of identifying and classifying objects, patterns, or features in images. It's widely used in applications such as facial recognition, self-driving cars, medical imaging, and more.

## üéØ Objective

The main objective is to classify images into predefined categories using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The model is trained on labeled image data and is evaluated for accuracy and generalization.

## üñºÔ∏è Dataset Overview

The dataset used typically contains labeled images sorted into directories based on categories.

### üîë Example Features:
- RGB images of fixed size (e.g., 64x64 or 128x128 pixels)
- Multiple classes (e.g., cats vs. dogs, digits, clothing items, etc.)
- Balanced or imbalanced label distribution

If a known dataset is used:
> **Example:** CIFAR-10, MNIST, or custom dataset with folder structure:
