# Image Recognition Using Deep Learning

## üìå Project Overview

This project aims to build an image classification model using deep learning techniques. Image recognition involves the process of identifying and classifying objects, patterns, or features in images. It's widely used in applications such as facial recognition, self-driving cars, medical imaging, and more.  For example a model can be trained to identify difference between different types of flowers, animals or traffic signs. In this project, we will use Tensorflow and Keras to build a simple image recognition model.

## üéØ Objective

The main objective is to classify images into predefined categories using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The model is trained on labeled image data and is evaluated for accuracy and generalization.

## üñºÔ∏è Dataset Overview

The dataset used typically contains labeled images sorted into directories based on categories.
We will be using flower dataset which contains 3,670 images with five classes labeled as daisy, dandelion, roses, sunflowers and tulips. Here, pathlib library is used to handle the path names of the downloaded image file.
