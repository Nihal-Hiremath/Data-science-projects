# 🧠 Image Recognition Using Neural Networks

Image recognition using neural networks is a cutting-edge technique in **artificial intelligence (AI)** that enables computers to **identify and classify objects in images**.

At the heart of this technology are **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** — specialized deep learning models that automatically extract and learn features such as:

- 📐 Edges  
- 🌀 Shapes  
- 🎨 Textures

These features are processed through multiple layers to detect patterns and make accurate predictions. For instance, a neural network trained on thousands of animal images can effectively distinguish between a **cat** and a **dog**.

### 🔍 Applications:
- 🔐 Facial Recognition  
- 🚗 Autonomous Vehicles  
- 🏥 Medical Image Analysis  
- 🛡️ Security & Surveillance

Thanks to large datasets and advanced architectures, the accuracy of neural networks in visual tasks continues to grow — making them a cornerstone of modern AI systems.

> 🚀 *As research advances, neural networks will continue to transform how machines understand and interact with visual data.*
