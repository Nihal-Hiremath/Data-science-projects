Accurately predicting hotel reservation cancellations is critical for revenue management and operational planning in the hospitality industry. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to forecast whether a booking is likely to be canceled based on customer behavior and reservation details.

The model uses features such as booking dates, lead time, room type, number of guests, deposit type, and special requests. After preprocessing and feature selection, classification algorithms like logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost are trained to classify reservations as likely to be canceled or honored.

By identifying potential cancellations in advance, hotels can minimize lost revenue, adjust inventory, and offer last-minute promotions to fill rooms. This helps optimize occupancy rates and improve customer service.

The project demonstrates how data-driven insights can enhance decision-making in hotel operations, contributing to more efficient management and a better guest experience.
