Timely product delivery is a key factor in customer satisfaction for e-commerce businesses. This project applies machine learning to predict whether a product will be delivered on time based on features such as order date, shipping method, product category, customer location, and warehouse processing time.

The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and training classification models like logistic regression, decision trees, and gradient boosting. These models analyze patterns in past deliveries to estimate the likelihood of delays and identify factors contributing to late shipments.

By predicting delivery outcomes, e-commerce platforms can optimize logistics, allocate resources efficiently, and proactively communicate with customers. This not only improves operational efficiency but also enhances the overall shopping experience.

The project showcases how predictive analytics can help reduce delivery issues, improve planning, and increase customer trust in online retail environments.
