Salary prediction using machine learning involves building models that estimate an individual’s potential salary based on various features such as education, experience, job role, location, and skills. By training on historical data containing these factors and corresponding salaries, machine learning algorithms can learn the underlying patterns and relationships. Common techniques include linear regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods like random forests or gradient boosting. These models analyze input data to predict salary ranges for new candidates or job profiles. Salary prediction helps employers set competitive compensation, aids job seekers in understanding market trends, and supports HR in workforce planning. As more data is collected, the model’s accuracy improves, making salary prediction a valuable tool for data-driven decision-making in recruitment and career development.
